This was an ongoing project I did while studying OOD, it is a working address book in which you could add, delete, and circle through the different entries.
It consists of 3 different frames to implement the use of the singleton design pattern, and also features a timeline that "refreshes" the fields in the frames to the current entries every set window of time.
This version contains all the features I could think of that might appear in the final exam, so I've added them for practice. Enjoy!
